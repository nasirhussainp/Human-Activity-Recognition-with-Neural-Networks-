Human Activity Recognition with Neural Networks  
Project Overview  
This project applies deep learning / neural-network techniques to the task of human activity recognition (HAR) â€” the aim is to classify different human activities (walking, sitting, etc.) using sensor data (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope). The core pipeline includes data loading, preprocessing, model architecture (neural network), training, evaluation, and inference.
Dataset  
Source: The dataset used in this notebook (e.g., inertial sensor data from smartphones / wearables).  
Because of GitHub size/storage constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository.  
Instruction: You must download the dataset from the original source (link in notebook) and place it in the appropriate folder (e.g., `data/`) before running the notebook.  
Format: Time-series sensor signals (accelerometer, gyroscope) + labels (activity classes).  
Important characteristics:  
  - Multi-channel time series (e.g., x-axis, y-axis, z-axis)  
  - Sliding windows or fixed length segments representing activities  
  - Multiple classes of activity (e.g., walking, sitting, lying)  
Note: Human activity recognition with sensor data is a common and studied problem. For example, the well-known UCI HAR Dataset includes 6 activities recorded from smartphone sensors. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Notebook / Code  
human_activity_recognition_neural_networks.ipynb` (or whatever your notebook file is) contains the full pipeline:  
  1. Data loading & preprocessing (normalisation, windowing, segmentation)  
  2. Preparing dataset (train/validation/test split)  
  3. Model architecture: neural network(s) (e.g., feedforward, CNN-LSTM, or fully connected)  
  4. Training loop: epochs, loss, optimizer settings  
  5. Evaluation: metrics such as accuracy, precision/recall, confusion matrix  
  6. Sample inference: showing how the model predicts on new sensor windows  
Ensure your notebook is well commented with markdown cells explaining each step, reasoning for design choices, hyper-parameters, etc.
